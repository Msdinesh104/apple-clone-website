🍏 Apple Website UI Clone

React.js + Vite + Tailwind CSS :
A fully static, visually accurate UI clone of the Apple India homepage — built as my first React.js project while learning component-based architecture.


🚀 Project Overview :
This project is a static UI recreation of the Apple website.
The main goal was to understand how React components work, how to structure a clean project, and how to build modern UIs using Tailwind CSS.

This project has no functionality — it focuses purely on layout, styling, and component structure.

🎯 Features :
✔ Component-Based Architecture
✔ Apple-style Navigation Bar
✔ Hero Section with Product Highlights
✔ Multiple Product Sections
✔ Reusable Button Component
✔ Responsive Footer
✔ Fully Responsive UI
